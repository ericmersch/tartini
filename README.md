# tartini
a simple pure data and javascript codes to experiment with Tartini tones aka resultant tones

We are familiar with the combination of colours: it is well known that adding green and red light result in the perception of yellow. But we are usually less concious of a similar phenomenon occuring with sound: when adding two pure sine waves of 800Hz and 1000Hz, one can hear a third sound at 200 Hz. This tone is not present in the acoustic signal, but it is thought to result from a non-linear phenomenon in the inner ear. This resultant tones fascinates me because they are like a ghost tones, or illusions. This code allows one to experiment with resultant tones.
